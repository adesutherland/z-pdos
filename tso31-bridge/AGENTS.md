# tso31-bridge agent guide

Read [the root guide](../AGENTS.md), README.md, UPSTREAM.md, LICENSE,
[AI guidance](doc/ai/README.md), the user and architecture documentation,
and [the backlog](doc/BACKLOG.md). Follow [the shared workflow](../doc/WORKFLOW.md).

Maintain one current product source tree in src/. Keep tests in tests/,
maintained cREXX recipes in scripts/ and generated output in root build/.
The optional archive/ is frozen and excluded from normal builds/required tests.
Record defects and future work only in doc/BACKLOG.md; Open does not authorise
implementation. Preserve behaviour during structural work and repair only
migration regressions. Do not commit, push or publish without session authority.

This is a synchronous non-reentrant 31-bit TSO-to-ELF entry adapter, not a z/PDOS kernel service implementation. Preserve its exact ABI and supported service forms. Host callbacks and deck/layout checks do not establish complete native runtime linking or guest execution.
